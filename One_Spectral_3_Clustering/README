1-SPECTRAL CLUSTERING


This archive contains a Matlab implementation of 1-Spectral 3-Clustering 
as described in the paper

% This file is obtained by a modification of OneSpectralClustering.m,

INSTALLATION

The implementation uses a mex-file to solve the inner problem of the
inverse power method. Compile it using 

mex -largeArrayDims solveInnerProblem.cpp 

in the matlab command line.


SHORT DOCUMENTATION

For more information, type help functionname in the Matlab command line.

Usage: [clusters3f,cheeger3f] = main(W)

Input: 
	W: Sparse weight matrix. Has to be symmetric.
	
Output:
        clusters3f: vector indicating the computed 3-clustering 
        cheeger3f: the corresponding Cheeger constant
